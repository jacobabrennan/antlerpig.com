		<h1>About</h1>
        <p>AntlerPig is the personal website of amateur game developer Jacob A. Brennan, and home to his various web projects. The blog is updated twice a week, with a release of some form on Sunday, and a progress and planning report on Wednesday.</p>
        <h2>What's with the animal thing?</h2>
		<p>An Antler Pig is a fictitious ungulate mammal and the subject of many drawings. The site may eventually host a webcomic by the same name. Meanwhile, an Antler Pig serves as the mascot for my projects and the site in general.</p>
